# Forest-Cover-Classification

The goal of this project was to build a deep learning model that predicts the forest cover type from different cartographic variables.

The cover types ['Spruce/Fir', 'Lodgepole Pine','Ponderosa Pine', 'Cottonwood/Willow','Aspen', 'Douglas-fir', 'Krummholz'] and a a csv file ('cover_data.csv') were given. There was no additional dataset or information about the use of predictions. Therefore, a proportion of the input was used as test data to create a successful model and classification metrics.
